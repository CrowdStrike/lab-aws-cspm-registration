# Cloud Security Lab Series
## AWS CSPM Registration FAQ


1. Will this lab allow me to demo AWS Organization registration?

This lab is limited to a single account, however later chapters will cover information related to Organization registration.

2. Can we use a GovCloud Falcon CID to complete this lab?

Yes!  CrowdStrike Falcon supports registering a Commercial AWS Account to GovCloud Falcon.  While the resources change to facilitate shipping events to enable IOAs, this lab provides the templates to complete this process.
